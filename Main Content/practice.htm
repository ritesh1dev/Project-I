         <header> The header HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or 
            navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</header>
            <article>
            A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of each article one after another as the reader scrolls, each post would be contained in an article element, possibly with one or more <section>s within.
            </article>
            <h1>this is heading </h1>
            <p>this is used for paragraph</p>
            <section>
            The section HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.
            </section>
            <aside>The aside HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</aside>
            <cite>The Little Mermaid</cite>
            <main>The main HTML element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.
                A document mustn't have more than one main element that doesn't have the hidden attribute specified.
                <!-- <hidden> -->

                    <!-- hidden -->
    <!-- An enumerated attribute indicating that the element is not yet, or is no longer, relevant. For example, it can be used to hide elements of the page that can't be used until the login process has been completed. The browser won't render such elements. This attribute must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be shown. -->
    <!-- </hidden> -->
                <hidden>

                hidden
An enumerated attribute indicating that the element is not yet, or is no longer, relevant. For example, it can be used to hide elements of the page that can't be used until the login process has been completed. The browser won't render such elements. This attribute must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be shown.
</hidden>
Landmark
The main element behaves like a main landmark role. Landmarks can be used by assistive technology to quickly identify and navigate to large sections of the document. Prefer using the main element over declaring role="main", unless there are legacy browser support concerns.

Skip navigation
Skip navigation, also known as "skipnav", is a technique that allows an assistive technology user to quickly bypass large sections of repeated content (main navigation, info banners, etc.). This lets the user access the main content of the page faster.

Adding an id attribute to the main element lets it be a target of a skip navigation link.
            </main>
<div>
    The div HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
    As a "pure" container, the div element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on.
    The div element should be used only when no other semantic element (such as article or nav) is appropriate.
</div>
<nav>The nav HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.</nav>
            <footer>
                <small> A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
                Enclose information about the author in an <address> element that can be included into the <footer> element.
                </small>
            </footer>
